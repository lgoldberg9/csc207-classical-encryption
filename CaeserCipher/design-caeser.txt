public static void cipher(String text, String flag)

1. What does this component do in a single sentence?
cipher computes the encrypted string and decrypts an encrypted string using the Caesar Cipher.

2. What is the interface to this component? What are its inputs and outputs?
Input is handled by main, which passes 2 strings to this function: text, and flag
The output of cipher is void since it has the side effect of printing the answer.

3. What are five representative test cases this component should pass?
Note: we choose a sample of outputs so we don't print the whole thing.
cipher("helloworldz", "encode"):
n = 0: helloworldz
n = 1: ifmmpxpsmea
n = 2: jgnnqyqtnfb

cipher("ifmmpxpsmea", "decode"):
n = 0: ifmmpxpsmea
n = 1: helloworldz
n = 2: gdkknvnqkcy

cipher("a", "encode"):
n = 0: a
n = 1: b
n = 2: c
n = 3: d

cipher("c", "decode"):
n = 0: c
n = 1: b
n = 2: a
n = 3: z

cipher("", "encode"):
n = 0: 
n = 1: 
n = 2:


private static void ShiftText(char[] text, int transposer)

1. What does this component do in a single sentence?
It shifts every letter in the array text up/down (depending on transposer) by 1.

2. What is the interface to this component? What are its inputs and outputs?
cipher calls this function 26 times so we can encode/decode the same string for each
letter in the alphabet. Its inputs are an array of chars called text, and a transposer.
It has no output, but it changes the array text points to (so it has side effects).

3. What are five representative test cases this component should pass?
Note: when we say -> {stuff}, we are saying the original array now looks like {stuff}
ShiftText({'y', 'z', 'a', 'b'}, 1) -> {'z', 'a', 'b', 'c'}
ShiftText({'y', 'z', 'a', 'b'}, -1) -> {'x', 'y', 'z', 'b'}
ShiftText({}, 1) -> {}
ShiftText({}, -1) -> {}
ShiftText({'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}, 1) -> {'i', 'f', 'm', 'm', 'p'}
