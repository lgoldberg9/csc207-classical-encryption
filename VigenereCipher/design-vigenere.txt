public static void cipher(String text, String key, String flag)

1. What does this component do in a single sentence?
cipher computes the encrypted string and decrypts an encrypted string using the Vigenere Cipher.

2. What is the interface to this component? What are its inputs and outputs?
Input is handled by main, which passes 3 strings to this function: text, key, flag.
The output of cipher is void since it has the side effect of printing the answer.

3. What are five representative test cases this component should pass?
cipher("helloworldzz", "cap", "encode") -> "jeanolqrafzo"
cipher("jeanolqraf", "cap", "decode") -> "helloworldzz"
cipher("pmiscool", "a", "encode") -> "pmiscool"
cipher("pmiscool", "a", "decode") -> "pmiscool"
cipher("pmiscool", "", "encode") -> "pmiscool"


private static char shiftChar(char ch, char key, int transposer)

1. What does this component do in a single sentence?
shiftChar takes a letter and a key letter, and shifts the letter up/down (depending on transposer)
by the value of the key letter.

2. What is the interface to this component? What are its inputs and outputs?

cipher passes this function a ch (char), key (char), and transposer (int)
output is a char, which is ch shifted up/down by transposer.

3. What are five representative test cases this component should pass?
shiftChar('b', 'a', 1) -> 'b'
shiftChar('c', 'a', -1) -> 'c'
shiftChar('d', 'f', 1) -> 'k'
shiftChar('a', 'c', -1) -> 'y'
shiftChar('z', 'b', 1) -> 'a'
